Summary
====
My goals for this repo is to
* add xinput awareness
* add ability to select from any master input devices available
* spawn "anonymous" master device to send input so as to not disturb your main mouse and destroy it after you're done
* hide any alternative cursor you use as to not be annoying
* ...


Old stuff
====
xdotool: Fake input from the mouse and keyboard very easily.
  Also supports window manager actions such as moving, activating, and other
  actions on windows.
libxdo: C library for doing the same.

See the website for more up-to-date documentation
  http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/
  or the manpage listed below.

Compile: make
Install: make install
Remove: make uninstall

You may have to set 'PREFIX' to the location you want to install to. 
The default PREFIX is /usr/local

For packagers, there's also support for DESTDIR for staged install.

Also, see the manpage, which you can generate by running:
  make showman
Note: the manpage will be installed during 'make install'
